    <h2> Welcome to Infinity</h2>
    
    <p>Big Room Studios created the Infinity Development Consulting process to meet a need expressed by many
      entrepreneurs, companies and organizations of documenting ideas and creating an actionable plan for new
      technology projects. During your Infinity experience, we will help you organize and examine your product
      ideas and requirements, developing a solid project plan that is ready for implementation.
    </p>

    <h2>Ignition</h2>

    <p>We will kick-off the process with a 3 hour planning and strategy session, where we get all your ideas, features
      and user stories out on the table, while discussing your overall business and development goals. We then write
      the Ignition Document, organizing and outlining this content for your review.
    </p>

    <h2>Flight Plan</h2>

    <p>During this phase, the plan created in the Ignition Document is transformed into an Information Architecture
      document and Wireframes of key screens, allowing you to visualize user flows for your new technology project.
    </p>

    <h2>Launch</h2>

    <p>In this last phase, we combine your Information Architecture, Designs, User Flows and Feature Descriptions with
      a Technical Development Plan, involving a detailed Sprint Schedule with actionable Development Tasks. This final
      Launch Document will also include a proposed project budget and timeline.
